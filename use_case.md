# Use Case: Cloud-Based Patient Intake and Triage System

## Problem Statement
- The healthcare scenario I selected is: a simple patient instake and triage app for a clinic. 
- I selected this scenario because many clinics rely on paper forms for patient intake. That process is slow and generates data that requires manual entry into an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system which can lead to transcription errors. Front desk staff generally collect patient information, verify insurance, answer calls and handle scheduling. Managing this many tasks can increase wait times, and result in data entry errors. 
- Clinics could really benefit from a streamlined, secure way to digitize patient intake, assess triage urgency based on reported symptoms and provide clinicians with organized patient queues. 

## Users
1. Patients — Individuals arriving at the clinic who need to check in, provide demographic and symptom information, and upload relevant documents (insurance cards, prior records, etc).
2. Front Desk Staff — Administrative personnel who monitor incoming patients, verify information, and manage the patient queue.
3. Clinicians (Nurses/Physicians/Clinical Staff) — Healthcare providers who need to view prioritized patient lists based on triage urgency, access patient-submitted information, and document encounters.

## Data Sources
- The system handles several categories of healthcare data:

| Data Type | Format | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Patient demographics | JSON/Form data | Patient self-entry via web form |
| Symptom questionnaire responses | JSON | Patient self-entry via structured intake form |
| Insurance card images | PNG/JPG | Patient upload via mobile or kiosk |
| Historical visit summaries | CSV | Batch upload from legacy EHR export (for initial migration) |
| Triage scores | Computed JSON | Generated by rule-based algorithm |

## Basic Workflow 
- Step 1: Patient Check-In
    → Patient accesses the intake form via clinic kiosk (tablet) or personal smartphone
    → Patient enters demographics, symptoms, and chief complaint
    → Patient optionally uploads insurance card image

- Step 2: Data Storage
    → Form data is submitted to Flask API running in a containerized environment
    → Structured data (demographics, symptoms) is written to Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)
    → Uploaded images are stored in Cloud Storage bucket

- Step 3: Triage Scoring
    → Upon submission, a simple rule-based algorithm calculates triage priority
    → Priority levels: Emergent (1), Urgent (2), Semi-Urgent (3), Non-Urgent (4)
    → Score is based on symptom keywords, vital signs (if entered), and chief complaint

- Step 4: Queue Management
    → Front desk dashboard displays all checked-in patients sorted by triage priority
    → Staff can manually adjust priority or mark patients as "in progress"

- Step 5: Clinician View
    → Clinicians access a read-only dashboard showing their assigned patient queue
    → Clicking a patient shows full intake details and any uploaded documents
    → After visit, clinician marks patient as "completed"
